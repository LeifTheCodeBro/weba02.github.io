                Archi.Techt started with a simple idea: build PCs that feel just as personal as the people using them. A
                few years ago, a small group of us, tech geeks, gamers, and dreamers got together in a cramped basement
                with a shared love for powerful hardware, sleek designs and small form factors. We wanted to break away
                from the typical, one-size-fits-all machines, and create something that would really let people's
                creativity run wild.<br><br>

                Our team grew quickly, bringing together enthusiasts from all over. Every person here brings
                something different to the table, from designers and builders who care about every little detail, to
                software engineers who make sure our systems run like a dream. We believe a PC shouldn't just work well;
                it should look and feel like it was made just for you.<br><br>

                Since those basement days, we've partnered with the best hardware suppliers, and we're always working on
                new tools that make building your own PC easier and more exciting. Whether you're gaming, designing, or
                just exploring what's possible, we want you to feel at home with our builds.<br><br>

                At the end of the day, Archi.Techt is about more than just tech. It's about bringing people together and
                helping them build something they're proud of. And as we keep growing, that's something we'll never
                change.
